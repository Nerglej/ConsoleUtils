# Console Utilities for C#
This project contains some simple utilities for reading and writing to the console in C#.
Reading from the console is often errorprone because of userinput. So you have to handle most outcomes.
Stuff like that is why this project exists.
And what if you want a fancy, slowed-down text that prints a single character every 50ms?
It's possible here as well.
And that it.

## Technical
Currently, this project is targeted at dotnet 6. It haven't been tested in anything else.

You can see an example of usage in the UtilExamples project in the solution.
